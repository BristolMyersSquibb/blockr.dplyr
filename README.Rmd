Extending `blockr.core` with blocks for data wrangling, `blockr.dplyr` wraps several `dplyr` verbs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of blockr.dplyr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cynkra/blockr.dplyr")
```

## Example

A `dplyr::select()` block can be spun up as

```{r select, eval = FALSE}
library(blockr.dplyr)
blockr.core::serve(new_select_block(c("mpg", "cyl")), list(data = mtcars))
```

and a two-table verb such as `dplyr::join()` is available as

```{r join, eval = FALSE}
library(blockr.dplyr)
blockr.core::serve(
  new_join_block(by = "name"),
  data = list(x = dplyr::band_members, y = dplyr::band_instruments)
)
```
