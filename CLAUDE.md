# blockr.dplyr Development Guide

## Overview
This document provides guidance for improving the `blockr.dplyr` package, which provides dplyr-powered data wrangling blocks for blockr.core.

## Current State

### Existing Blocks
- **select** - Column selection
- **filter** - Row filtering with conditions  
- **mutate** - Add/modify columns with multi-expression support ✅
- **arrange** - Row ordering
- **summarize** - Group summaries with `.by` parameter and multi-expression support ✅
- **join** - Combining tables (lower priority)

### Recently Completed ✅
1. **Multi-expression support** - Both mutate and summarize blocks now support multiple expressions with dynamic add/remove functionality
2. **dplyr function compatibility** - Fixed `n()`, `first()`, `last()`, `row_number()` and other dplyr functions by properly importing them via `@importFrom`
3. **Clean code architecture** - Removed complex regex preprocessing in favor of proper namespace imports
4. **Comprehensive testing** - Added 30+ tests covering single/multiple expressions, grouping, and edge cases
5. **Proper roxygen workflow** - Updated package to use roxygen2 for NAMESPACE generation

### Recently Completed ✅ 
6. **Fixed autocompletion** - ACE editors in mutate and summarize blocks now properly support:
   - Column name suggestions from input data
   - dplyr function suggestions (`n()`, `mean()`, `sum()`, `first()`, `lag()`, etc.)
   - Improved timing of editor initialization to prevent race conditions
   - Enhanced function categories including window functions and filter functions

## Current Status: Ready for Production

### Working Features ✅
- **Multi-expression support** in mutate and summarize blocks
- **Dynamic add/remove** expressions with proper UI feedback
- **dplyr function compatibility** - all common functions work correctly
- **Comprehensive autocompletion** - column names and function suggestions
- **Proper state management** - save/restore functionality works
- **Full test coverage** - 55 tests covering all functionality
- **Clean architecture** - proper namespace imports, no regex preprocessing

## Future Enhancements to Consider

### New Blocks
- **group_by** - Explicit grouping block
- **rename** - Column renaming
- **distinct** - Remove duplicates
- **slice** variants - Row selection by position

### UI/UX Improvements
- Drag-and-drop for reordering expressions
- Better validation messages
- Template/snippet system for common operations
- Column picker UI improvements

## Design Philosophy

### Modularity
The blockr ecosystem favors modular, reusable components. Consider creating modules that could be reused across different blocks.

### User Experience
- Make common tasks easy
- Provide helpful defaults
- Give clear feedback on errors
- Support both beginners and advanced users

### Code Patterns
Follow the existing patterns in the codebase:
- Blocks use `new_transform_block()` as a base
- Modules use `moduleServer()` and return reactive values
- State is managed through reactive expressions
- UI and server logic are separated

## Technical Considerations

### Package Development
- This package uses roxygen2 for documentation and NAMESPACE generation
- After modifying imports (e.g., adding @importFrom statements), run `devtools::document()` or `roxygen2::roxygenise()` to regenerate NAMESPACE
- Do not edit NAMESPACE directly - use roxygen comments in R files

### Testing Workflow
After making changes to the code, use this workflow to test:

**Option 1: R Console (Recommended)**
1. Install package: `R CMD INSTALL . --no-multiarch`
2. Open R console/RStudio
3. Run: `library(blockr.core); serve(new_summarize_block(), list(data = mtcars))`
4. Test in browser: Check multi-expressions, dplyr functions, autocompletion

**Option 2: Development Testing**
1. `pkgload::load_all()` (loads development code without installing)
2. Run example manually in R console/RStudio
3. Alternative: `serve(new_mutate_block(), list(data = mtcars))`

**Option 3: Automated Testing**
- Run `devtools::test()` to ensure all unit tests pass
- This verifies core functionality without needing browser testing

**Note**: Running Shiny apps via command-line scripts may not work reliably in all environments. Use R console/RStudio for interactive testing.

### Shiny Reactivity
- Be mindful of reactive dependencies
- Use `isolate()` when needed to prevent circular updates
- Consider using `reactiveVal()` for values that need explicit control

### ACE Editor Integration
- The package uses ACE editors for code input
- Initialize them properly for dynamic content
- Set up autocompletion with column names

### State Management
- State must be serializable for save/restore functionality
- Return state as a list from blocks
- Handle both initialization and updates gracefully

## Success Criteria
- Users can easily add multiple mutations or summaries
- The interface is intuitive and responsive
- Existing functionality remains intact
- Code is clean and maintainable
- Tests pass and coverage improves

## Resources
- Check git history for previous implementations
- Look at existing modules for patterns
- The blockr.core package documentation
