\usage{
new_join_block(type = character(), by = character(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{Join type (left_join, inner_join, right_join, full_join, semi_join, anti_join)}

\item{by}{Column(s) to join on - can be character vector for same-name joins
or named list for different-name joins}

\item{...}{Forwarded to \code{\link[blockr.core:new_block]{blockr.core::new_block()}}}
}
\description{
This block allows for joining of two \code{data.frame} objects with advanced
multi-column support including same-name and different-name joins (see
\code{\link[dplyr:mutate-joins]{dplyr::left_join()}}, \code{\link[dplyr:mutate-joins]{dplyr::inner_join()}}, etc.).
