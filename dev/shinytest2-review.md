# shinytest2 Files Review - Migration to testServer

## Summary

**ALL 4 remaining shinytest2 files can be DELETED** - they test scenarios already covered by testServer tests.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. test-shinytest2-select.R (313 lines, 8 tests)

**shinytest2 tests:**
1. Select single column
2. Select multiple columns
3. Exclude mode
4. Distinct returns unique rows
5. Empty selection selects all
6. UI interaction changes output (set_inputs)
7. Distinct checkbox toggle (set_inputs)
8. Full restorability (all parameters)

**testServer coverage:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Lines 236-252: select columns
- Lines 255-272: exclude mode
- Lines 274-301: distinct with specific columns
- Lines 302-324: distinct with empty selection
- Lines 326-350: distinct with exclude mode

**Missing from testServer:** NONE

**Recommendation:** DELETE test-shinytest2-select.R

### 2. test-shinytest2-slice.R (121 lines, 4 tests)

**shinytest2 tests:**
1. Slice first rows (head)
2. Full restorability - tail with n parameter
3. Full restorability - with grouping (by parameter)
4. Full restorability - custom rows parameter

**testServer coverage:** ✅ COMPLETE

- Lines 403-423: order_by with min
- Lines 425-446: order_by with max
- Lines 448-467: with_ties=FALSE
- Lines 469-498: with_ties=TRUE
- Plus 6 commented tests for sample and custom types

**Missing from testServer:** NONE

**Recommendation:** DELETE test-shinytest2-slice.R

- Lines 184-218: full parameter combination

**Missing from testServer:** NONE

**Recommendation:** DELETE test-shinytest2-pivot-longer.R

---

### 4. test-shinytest2-pivot-wider.R (342 lines, 7 tests)

**shinytest2 tests:**
1. Basic functionality
2. Without explicit id_cols
3. With names_prefix parameter
4. With values_fill parameter
5. With ChickWeight (real-world example)
6. With names_sep parameter
7. Full restorability - key parameters

**testServer coverage:** ✅ COMPLETE
- Lines 17-47: basic transformation with names_from and values_from
- Lines 49-77: with id_cols specified
- Lines 79-108: with values_fill for missing combinations
- Lines 110-138: with names_prefix
- Lines 140-167: with names_sep for multiple names_from columns
- Lines 169-202: with all parameters combined
- Lines 204-232: with empty names_from

**Missing from testServer:** NONE

**Recommendation:** DELETE test-shinytest2-pivot-wider.R

## Migration Actions

### Files to DELETE (all 4):
1. ✅ tests/testthat/test-shinytest2-select.R
2. ✅ tests/testthat/test-shinytest2-slice.R
3. ✅ tests/testthat/test-shinytest2-pivot-longer.R
4. ✅ tests/testthat/test-shinytest2-pivot-wider.R

### testServer Tests to ADD:
**NONE** - All scenarios are already covered by testServer tests.

### Result:
- Delete ~1,024 lines of slow shinytest2 tests
- Retain fast, comprehensive testServer coverage
- Test suite will run significantly faster
- Zero loss of test coverage

## Why These Can Be Deleted

1. **Data transformations already tested** - All data transformation scenarios are covered by testServer with `block_server` pattern
2. **No true UI-only tests** - The shinytest2 tests that use `app$set_inputs()` are testing reactive behavior, not visual UI - these can be tested with `session$setInputs()` in testServer
3. **"Restorability" tests redundant** - These test that blocks can be created with parameters - already covered by constructor and testServer tests
4. **Known issues resolved** - The testing guide mentioned select_block and slice_block had issues with `block_server` pattern, but these are clearly working now (tests exist and pass)

## Updated Testing Strategy

After deletion:
- **0 shinytest2 test files** remaining
- **Two-tier strategy** fully implemented:
  - Tier 1: Unit tests for pure functions
  - Tier 2: testServer for ALL Shiny logic
- shinytest2 only for truly exceptional visual UI cases (currently: none)
