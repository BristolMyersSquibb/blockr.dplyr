      "## Pivot Wider Block Demo\n\n",
      "This workflow demonstrates the `new_pivot_wider_block()` for reshaping long data to wide format.\n\n",

      "### What is Pivot Wider?\n\n",
      "Pivot wider transforms long data (many rows) into wide data (more columns, fewer rows).\n",
      "This is useful for creating summary tables or matrices where row-column combinations become cells.\n\n",

      "### Dataset: ChickWeight\n\n",
      "The `ChickWeight` dataset tracks weight of chicks over time on different diets.\n",
      "It's in long format: Each row is one chick at one time point.\n\n",

      "### What this workflow does:\n\n",
      "1. Loads the `ChickWeight` dataset (578 rows in long format)\n",
      "2. **Filters** to specific time points (Day 0, 10, 20)\n",
      "3. **Filters** to first 5 chicks for manageable output\n",
      "4. **Pivots** to wide format:\n",
      "   - `names_from = 'Time'` - Creates columns for each time point\n",
      "   - `values_from = 'weight'` - Fills cells with weight values\n",
      "   - `names_prefix = 'day_'` - Adds 'day_' prefix to column names\n",
      "   - Result: One row per chick, with day_0, day_10, day_20 columns\n",
      "5. **Calculates** weight gain between time periods\n",
      "6. **Arranges** by total weight gain (highest first)\n\n",

      "### Why Pivot This Data?\n\n",
      "- **Time comparison**: Easy to see all time points for one chick in a single row\n",
      "- **Calculate changes**: Simpler to calculate differences between time points\n",
      "- **Summary tables**: Creates a more readable summary format\n",
      "- **Matrix operations**: Wide format works better for certain calculations\n\n",

      "### Common Use Cases:\n\n",
      "- **Crosstabs**: Creating frequency tables (rows Ã— columns)\n",
      "- **Time series**: Converting long format to one column per time period\n",
      "- **Pivot tables**: Creating Excel-style pivot table layouts\n",
      "- **Before/after comparisons**: Side-by-side comparison of measurements\n",
      "- **Correlation analysis**: Wide format needed for correlation matrices\n\n",

      "### Try these features:\n\n",
      "- **Change time points**: Filter to different days (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 21)\n",
      "- **Change names/values**: Try pivoting by `Diet` instead of `Time`\n",
      "- **Fill missing values**: Use `values_fill` to replace NAs (e.g., '0' or 'NA')\n",
      "- **Remove prefix**: Clear `names_prefix` to get columns named '0', '10', '20'\n",
      "- **Specify ID columns**: Use `id_cols` to control which columns identify rows\n\n",
