# Benefits of this structure:
# 1. Users looking for "filter" see both options together
# 2. Simple variant listed first (most users start here)
# 3. Expression variant immediately below (natural progression)
# 4. Clear descriptions help users choose
# 5. Logical grouping by operation type
# 6. Room to add simple variants later (e.g., new_mutate_block)
