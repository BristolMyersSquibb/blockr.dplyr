# shinytest2 Tests - Fully Migrated to testServer ✅

## Migration Complete

**All shinytest2 tests have been successfully migrated to testServer.**

### Files Deleted (2025-01)

The following shinytest2 files were deleted after confirming equivalent testServer coverage exists:

- ✅ `test-shinytest2-select.R` (313 lines, 8 tests) → Covered by test-select.R
- ✅ `test-shinytest2-slice.R` (121 lines, 4 tests) → Covered by test-slice.R
- ✅ `test-shinytest2-pivot-longer.R` (248 lines, 5 tests) → Covered by test-pivot_longer.R
- ✅ `test-shinytest2-pivot-wider.R` (342 lines, 7 tests) → Covered by test-pivot_wider.R

**Total deleted:** ~1,024 lines of slow browser-based tests

### Previously Migrated

The following files were migrated in earlier work:

- `test-shinytest2-arrange.R` → test-arrange.R
- `test-shinytest2-bind.R` → test-bind.R
- `test-shinytest2-filter.R` → test-filter.R
- `test-shinytest2-join.R` → test-join.R
- `test-shinytest2-mutate.R` → test-mutate.R
- `test-shinytest2-rename.R` → test-rename.R
- `test-shinytest2-summarize.R` → test-summarize.R
- `test-shinytest2-value-filter.R` → test-value_filter.R

## Why We Migrated

1. **Speed**: testServer is 20-50x faster than shinytest2
2. **Simplicity**: No browser setup (chromote) required
3. **Debugging**: Direct access to server state and reactives
4. **Coverage**: testServer can test all Shiny logic, including UI interactions via `session$setInputs()`

## Current Testing Strategy

**Two-tier approach:**

1. **Unit Tests** - Pure R functions (expression builders, helpers)
2. **testServer** - ALL Shiny reactivity and UI interactions

**No shinytest2** - It's almost never needed. See [testing-guide.md](testing-guide.md) for details.

## If You Think You Need shinytest2

**Stop and ask yourself:**
- Can I test this with `session$setInputs()` in testServer? → Almost always YES
- Am I testing logic or just visual UI layout? → Logic = testServer
- Do I need a browser? → Almost always NO

**See [testing-guide.md](testing-guide.md) for the complete decision tree.**

## Testing Approach

**blockr.dplyr uses a two-tier testing strategy:**
1. **Unit tests** for pure R functions
2. **testServer** for ALL Shiny logic and UI interactions

All scenarios previously tested with shinytest2 are now covered by faster, simpler testServer tests.
